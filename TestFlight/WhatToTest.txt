=====================================
v1.0.5 - 2025-12-19
=====================================

What's New:
- Model Selection - Choose which Claude model to use for changelog generation. Opus users can now hand off to faster models like Sonnet or Haiku.

Improvements:
- Persistent Preferences - Model choice can be saved to project config for future runs
- Consistent Model Usage - All plugin commands use the same model setting

Key Areas to Test:

1. Model Selection Prompt
   - Run /changelog:changelog in a new project (no config)
   - Verify prompt appears asking which model to use
   - Test selecting each option: Current, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku

2. Save Model Preference
   - When prompted, choose to save preference
   - Verify .claude/config.json is created/updated with model setting
   - Run /changelog:changelog again - should not prompt for model

3. Model Inheritance
   - Set model to "inherit" in config
   - Verify plugin uses current conversation model
   - Test with different conversation models

Feedback Focus:
- Is the model selection prompt clear?
- Are the model descriptions helpful for choosing?

=====================================
v1.0.4 - 2025-12-19
=====================================

Improvements:
- Localized TestFlight Support - WhatToTest now uses locale-specific filenames (WhatToTest.en-US.txt) matching TestFlight's format
- Smarter File Detection - Automatically finds existing WhatToTest files regardless of locale variant
- Consistent Updates - Always prompts whether to append or replace existing test notes

Key Areas to Test:

1. Localized Filename Detection
   - Rename this file to WhatToTest.en-US.txt
   - Run /changelog:whattotest and verify it finds the renamed file
   - Confirm it prompts to prepend or replace

2. New File Creation
   - In a project without WhatToTest, run /changelog:whattotest
   - Verify default filename is WhatToTest.en-US.txt (not .txt)
   - Test both TestFlight folder and project root locations

3. Append/Replace Prompt
   - Run /changelog:whattotest when file exists
   - Verify prompt appears asking to prepend or replace
   - Test both options work correctly

=====================================
v1.0.3 - 2025-12-19
=====================================

What's New:
- Separate Release Notes - Public release notes now generated as their own file (changelog-public.md) for easy sharing

Improvements:
- Smarter TestFlight Detection - WhatToTest prompts only appear for iOS/macOS projects
- Flexible File Locations - WhatToTest.txt can now be placed at project root or TestFlight folder
- Cleaner Test Notes - Simplified WhatToTest format with just version and date header
- Better Config Persistence - Preferences are now reliably saved when you choose to remember them

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed config file not being created when saving preferences

Key Areas to Test:

1. Split Changelog Output
   - Run /changelog:changelog and verify two files are generated
   - Check changelog.md has Problem/Solution format
   - Check changelog-public.md has user-friendly format

2. WhatToTest Location
   - Test output to TestFlight/ folder (default)
   - Test output to project root
   - Verify location preference is saved to config

3. Xcode Detection
   - Run in non-Xcode project - should skip WhatToTest prompt
   - Run in Xcode project - should prompt for WhatToTest
   - Test manual override via config

4. Config Persistence
   - Choose to save preferences when prompted
   - Verify .claude/config.json is created/updated correctly
