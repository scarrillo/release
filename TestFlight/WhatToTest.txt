=====================================
v1.0.3 - 2025-12-19
=====================================

What's New:
- Separate Release Notes - Public release notes now generated as their own file (changelog-public.md) for easy sharing

Improvements:
- Smarter TestFlight Detection - WhatToTest prompts only appear for iOS/macOS projects
- Flexible File Locations - WhatToTest.txt can now be placed at project root or TestFlight folder
- Cleaner Test Notes - Simplified WhatToTest format with just version and date header
- Better Config Persistence - Preferences are now reliably saved when you choose to remember them

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed config file not being created when saving preferences

Key Areas to Test:

1. Split Changelog Output
   - Run /changelog:changelog and verify two files are generated
   - Check changelog.md has Problem/Solution format
   - Check changelog-public.md has user-friendly format

2. WhatToTest Location
   - Test output to TestFlight/ folder (default)
   - Test output to project root
   - Verify location preference is saved to config

3. Xcode Detection
   - Run in non-Xcode project - should skip WhatToTest prompt
   - Run in Xcode project - should prompt for WhatToTest
   - Test manual override via config

4. Config Persistence
   - Choose to save preferences when prompted
   - Verify .claude/config.json is created/updated correctly
